## About the Challenge

The 100 Days of Coding Python challenge is an initiative to consistently work on coding projects and improve Python skills. The challenge involves dedicating at least an hour every day to coding, learning, and building various Python projects.

## My Goals

- Improve my Python programming skills.
- Gain hands-on experience in building real-world projects.
- Learn and apply different Python libraries and frameworks.
- Develop problem-solving and algorithmic thinking abilities.

# Day-1
## Band Name Generator

This is a simple Python program that generates band names using the name of your city and your pet's name.

**How It Works**

1. The program will prompt you to enter the name of your city.
2. Then, it will ask you to provide your pet's name.
3. The program will combine the two names to create a unique band name.

## Breakdown of Basic Python concepts used in Day-1
 The "Band Name Generator" program is a simple example that uses some basic concepts of Python programming. 

1. **Input and Output:**
   The program uses the `input()` function to prompt the user for input. It then uses the `print()` function to display the generated band name.

2. **Variables:**
   The program uses variables to store the user's input (`name` and `name2`) and the combined band name (`band_name`).

3. **String Concatenation:**
   String concatenation is used to combine the user's input for the city name and pet's name to create the band name. The `+` operator is used to concatenate strings.

4. **Control Flow:**
   The program follows a linear sequence of steps, where each step prompts the user for input and then proceeds to the next step. There are no explicit conditional statements or loops in this program.

5. **Function Calls:**
   The program uses the `input()` and `print()` functions, which are built-in Python functions, to interact with the user and display output.

# Day-2
## Tip Calculator

This is a simple Python program that calculates the total bill per person, including the tip, based on the total bill amount, tip percentage, and the number of people sharing the bill.

**How It Works**

1. The program will prompt you to enter the total bill amount.
2. Then, it will ask you to provide the tip percentage you want to give (10, 12, or 15).
3. Next, it will prompt you to specify the number of people sharing the bill.
4. The program will calculate the tip amount, add it to the total bill, and then divide the total among the specified number of people.
5. It will display the amount each person needs to pay.
